lightmg,WEAPON,"A venerable low-cost, readily available rapid fire weapon which has been used effectively versus missiles and fighters at short range throughout the history of combat in space. It is nearly useless versus properly armored targets.

Due to ease of manufacture, hundreds of models exist in the Sector. Any weapon that employs chemical propellant to fire inert projectiles at over 1200 rounds per minute can be classified as a light ship-mounted machine gun, but beyond that the mechanisms that drive the actions of these weapons vary considerably. 

Popular with small civilian craft due to low cost ammunition. Projectiles jacketed with metals that have a high melting point allow greater muzzle velocity and deliver a surprisingly large amount of kinetic energy at close-range.",,,,
lightdualmg,WEAPON,"An upgraded, twin barrel version of the venerable light machine gun. Not effective against armored targets, but has excelled in an anti-missile and fighter role since the dawn of human space combat.

This is a dual mount of the same rapid fire, inert, low-caliber chemical projectile weapon known to every pilot in the Sector. An excellent point defense mount, which excels in both a missile interdiction and anti-fighter role. 

The large amount of kinetic energy delivered to shield systems of enemy craft at close-range typically causes emitter overload, a tactical option often overlooked by inexperienced captains.",,,,
lightmortar,WEAPON,"An antiquated weapon that fires anti-armor rounds at a low rate of fire, muzzle velocity, and range. Its low flux buildup is a lone saving grace.

The weapon blueprints for Light Mortars actually did not intend them for spacecraft at all, but an ingenious modification to the breech loading mechanism permits installation and use outside an atmospheric environment. In combat, there is little the Light Mortar can do versus moving or shielded targets due to its terrible mount rotation and rate of fire. Nonetheless, it is often used for training novice gunnery officers in the finer points of space ballistic tactics and nomenclature.

Commonly fitted on private yachts and solo interplanetary vehicles because it is so light and cheap.",,,,
heavymortar,WEAPON,"An antiquated weapon that fires larger anti-armor rounds at a somewhat higher rate of fire than its smaller cousin. Projectile speed is low and effective range is short. Low flux buildup is a lone saving grace.

The Heavy Mortar was originally designed for use in planetary surface combat. Ostensibly intended for cracking fortifications, it saw far more use in urban bombardment. The robust internal mechanisms permit installation and use outside an atmospheric environment with only minor adjustments, notably replacement of the automatic rangefinder/targeting module. If employed against a large, unshielded, and slow-moving target, the heavy mortar can prove most effective.",,,,
vulcan,WEAPON,"A rapid fire weapon that is especially devastating to missiles and fighters at point-blank range. Accuracy degrades sharply during prolonged bursts. 

An advanced timing mechanism beats in the heart of this multi-barrel weapon platform, generally manufactured only by licensed Hegemony Autofactories. Rounds typically use depleted uranium tips and are non explosive. Multiple barrels enable an extremely high rate of fire, which comes at a cost in flux.",,,,
lightac,WEAPON,"A small caliber autocannon with a good range for such a light weapon. Designed to weaken enemy shields, especially effective against weaker generators.

The weapon fires high velocity kinetic rounds designed to overload enemy shields with ease. Features an autoloader and is liquid cooled. 

Excellent fire support weapon for smaller craft.  Poor mount turn rate makes it a bad choice vs fighters and missiles.",,,,
lightdualac,WEAPON,"A double barreled version of the Light AC. An excellent weapon for close-range support, and quite effective at bringing shields down, it suffers from a shorter effective range due to high recoil.

An ingeniously elegant mechanical design prevents ejection ports from being jammed while expelling twice as many spent shell casings as the standard chassis. Like the single barrel version, the weapon fires high velocity rounds designed to punch through enemy shields. Autoloader and liquid cooling systems are identical to the single barrel version.",,,,
lightag,WEAPON,"A small caliber cannon designed for close-range fights, excellent versus armor and with a superb fire rate.

Small caliber cannon designed to fire high-explosive rounds. Design of the coolant systems and autoloader emphasizes safety and prevention of cook-off potentially caused by high flux levels. Favored by destroyer captains that have something to prove.",,,,
fragbomb,WEAPON,"Releases a cluster of free-floating bomblets that retain the momentum of the launching craft. The bomblets are equipped with a proximity fuse.

A Frag Bomb projector fires Mark VI fragmentation bomblets from three tubes. Unguided and without a propulsion system, the bomblets rely on a friend-or-foe targeting system. Their vast numbers allow them to cover a wide swath of space, effectively creating a Point Defense barrier in that location, albeit for a limited time. When the proximity fuse is triggered by an enemy craft, the bomblet will detonate, achieving similar effects to those of flak weapons.",,,,
clusterbomb,WEAPON,"Releases a cluster of free-floating, high-explosive bomblets. More effective versus unshielded and slow-moving targets.

A Cluster Bomb projector is equipped with three tubes designed to fire dozens of Mark II Explosively Formed Penetrator bomblets. The bomblets are unguided and have no propulsion system, relying on the initial momentum of the strike craft to engage the target. They are equipped with a friend-or-foe targeting scanner, and will only detonate when impacting an appropriate target. The shaped charge explosive is highly effective versus unshielded targets. The sheer number of bomblets that can be deployed by this weapon system is staggering, and as such it makes the Cluster Bomb a useful area denial weapon.",,,,
bomb,WEAPON,"A tried and tested weapon system, the bomb bay holds multiple warheads that rely on the velocity of the launching craft to reach their target.

Each bomb bay is equipped with several non guided high-explosive Comp-X bombs that can be released one at a time. The bombs have no propulsion system and are dependent on the velocity of the launching craft to carry them to target (i.e., dive bombing).  Atmospheric shielding intrinsic to the design also gives the bombs a high Time To Live in an hostile Point-Defense environment.",,,,
lightneedler,WEAPON,"Fires bursts of small flechettes at a high rate of fire. The volume of fire can quickly overwhelm shield projectors, but is generally ineffective against armor.

A Light Needler is a small-bore flechette gun, designed to fire caseless ammunition. Features an impressive feed system which can deliver hundreds of ""needles"" per second. There is no need for an ejector system, and the resulting space availability is instead used to provide additional cooling units, vastly enhancing the rate of fire. 

Domain Naval doctrine holds that the weapon is to be used on enemy shields at long-range, but in a pinch, gunnery officers will train their Needlers on enemy fighter wings and long-range missile threats.",,,,
railgun,WEAPON,"A high-tech improvement of the Autocannon, the railgun fires accurate, medium-range slugs. Like the AC, it excels at overwhelming enemy shield generators.

A miniaturized version of the Gauss Cannon, the railgun relies on a strong magnetic field to fire shells at high velocities. The accuracy and range are excellent, and the turret is able to rotate quickly while not firing. 

The railgun is preferred to the Autocannon by gunnery officers that have ample flux capacity at their disposal.",,,,
shredder,WEAPON,"A rotatory cannon with generous engineering specifications which provide for great ease of operation and reliability. Weapons officers across the professional navies of the Sector, meanwhile, curse the Thumper for rewarding poor maintenance habits. 

Shreds enemy missiles and fighters with an overwhelming hail of small payload, medium velocity fragmentation rounds. Although flux-efficient, this weapon system has little effect against armor and shields.",,,,
flak,WEAPON,"A defensive weapon system that fires shrapnel-filled shells equipped with a proximity fuse for maximum effect against fighters and missiles.

The rising prominence of small, cheap fighter craft, especially in the strike role, led to a wider deployment of this weapons system in the heady days pre-Collapse. Fires ballistic rounds fitted with a proximity fuse. The resulting explosion sends a hail of flechettes in a wide area with a respectable kill radius versus standard targets. Newer models feature a fire control system hardwired into a Mark VI Predictor.",,,,
heavymg,WEAPON,"A larger cousin of the ubiquitous rapid-fire machine gun category of weapons, the Heavy MG is effective against both small and medium-sized targets.

A workhorse of patrol craft across the Sector, this weapons system features reliable blowback firing mechanism said to date back to the days of Old Earth. Safety features include a positive cook-off safety for open bolt clearing and double ram prevention. The weapon is typically mounted on a relatively heavy base to help absorb recoil during prolonged bursts of fire. Calibers vary within a moderate range and ammunition is easily fabricated by standard forges. 

The heavier projectiles do not shatter upon impact like lighter ammunition and present a credible threat to frigate-class vessels. Extremely accurate, though slower-firing than a vulcan cannon. Excels in a point-defense role.",,,,
arbalest,WEAPON,"An antiquated weapon design with high per-shot damage for its size. The kinetic shells are especially effective versus enemy shields.

Heavier patrol craft at the time of the Collapse were mostly fitted with the Arbalest Mk I weapons platform; this likely explains why the Arbalest is claimed to be among the most scavenged ship weapon systems in the Sector. The primitive cooling system and a lack of an autoejector hamper rate of fire and reliability. 

The only redeeming feature is the ubiquity of blueprints for the arbalest round, which is effective at bringing down enemy shields. The effectiveness of the shells is poorly understood, and is suspected to lie in the unintended electromagnetic properties of the shell jackets.",,,,
dualflak,WEAPON,"An upgraded, viciously effective dual mount of the Flak Cannon. Nicknamed ""The Widowmaker"" for its ability to tear apart incoming fighters.

Just like the standard flak cannon, this weapon devastates smaller fighter and missile targets, firing two proximity fuse fitted rounds. Shaped dispersal ensures dual detonation and a higher kill radius. Fighter craft are rarely launched against ships that are fitted with this weapon system, out of fear of what it can do. Excellent rate of fire and turret turn rate.",,,,
chaingun,WEAPON,"The GA-X Industries Mk. II chaingun excels at close-range fighting, where accuracy is less important than overall damage and volume of fire.

A 'melee' captain's favorite tool, the Assault Chaingun delivers high-explosive shaped charge rounds on target at nearly 400 shells per minute. Features electrically driven feed and ejector systems and an advanced nano cooling unit built right into the barrel. 

The only drawback is a heavier turret profile which, coupled with the lack of the accompanying governor blueprint, is typically mounted on incompatible rotators giving rise to unexpectedly low turret rotation speeds.",,,,
heavymauler,WEAPON,"An advanced weapon system designed to punch through armor plating at long-range. Has a low sustained rate of fire but high per-burst damage.

A brutal weapon, the heavy mauler is designed to engage targets at medium to long-range. At its core, the weapon is an autocannon with a nano-cooling system and an external ejection port. However, unlike normal autocannons, the heavy mauler is distinguished by an antimatter barrel charger fed by trivial amounts of standard starship fuel.

When leaving the firing chamber, each shell ogive is charged with a field of antiprotons which hovers 10-20 nanometers in front of the shell, stabilized by a baryon coating. On impact with a target, this antiproton ""sheath"" loses structural integrity and the resulting reaction does further damage. Given the fact that shells already deliver impressive destructive force to the target, the combined reaction makes the heavy mauler particularly effective versus armored targets.",,,,
heavyac,WEAPON,"A triple-barreled cannon that fires a burst of standardized shells at medium range. It is most effective versus enemy shields.

Medium caliber, triple-barreled autocannon, typically deployed with medium-bore ammunition. Electrically primed firing fuses ensure precise fire counts. A great fire support weapon, it is typically fitted on destroyer and cruiser class ships. A battery of heavy autocannons with a proper firing solution may pose a serious threat to capital ships. 

Additional mass necessity to accommodate the complex autoloader and cooling systems results in a very poor turn rate.",,,,
hveldriver,WEAPON,"A specialized weapon designed to overload and disable enemy systems from afar. The high-velocity duranium slug is also effective against shields.

The hypervelocity driver uses a 2-stage process to accelerate a duranium slug with a magnetized iron-cobalt core to a very high velocity. A chemical charge accelerates the slug first, then the magnetic coils take over, accelerating the slug further and stabilizing its flight. The slug is highly charged by the time it reaches the target, generating a significant amount of electromagnetic interference on the ship it impacts.",,,,
heavyneedler,WEAPON,"A dual-mount of the Light Needler with a heavier base, this advanced weapon system is capable of quickly overwhelming shield projectors.

The Heavy Needler is an advanced weapon that fires small flechette rounds. An improvement upon the Light Needler, it features better feed and cooling systems, which enable an even greater rate of fire. Projectiles are identical to the light version: caseless ammunition tungsten-jacketed flechettes.",,,,
gauss,WEAPON,"A long-range weapon designed to overload the target's shields. The heavy kinetic slug it fires is also effective against all but the heaviest armor.

Uses magnetic coils to accelerate a large ultra-dense composite slug to relativistic speeds. Usually rated at the hundreds of giga-amperes range, rarely exceeding one tera-ampere. Unlike most ballistic weapons, has a very high flux load when fired. Turrets mounted with this system have an extremely poor turn rate. 

Very effective weapon whose usefulness is limited by the low reactor power of ships that typically feature large ballistic weapon mounts. ",,,,
hephag,WEAPON,"A medium-range gun designed to punch through heavy armor. The raw damage output also enables it to overwhelm weaker shield emitters.

A truly devastating weapon platform, named for an archaic god of volcanoes. A typical turret mount features two L/89 barrels that trade off firing armor-destroying rounds at 240 RPM. An electromagnetic ejector, powered feed system and nanocoolants allow the weapon to fire for extended time periods. The shaped charge shells have low muzzle velocity and great armor penetrating power. ",,,,
mark9,WEAPON,"An imposing medium range autocannon, most effective versus shields. Also obliterates unarmored hulls with a large volume of heavy caliber projectiles.

It is known that warships of the early epoch of the Domain lacked contemporary levels of armor protection. A weapon with a name like the Mark IX Autocannon was probably a refinement of the earliest schools of weapons engineering in the Domain. Two barrels combined with a unique double-loader system form the core of the weapon system.

The Mark IX blueprints were first re-discovered in the Sector from a drifting derelict captured in the gravity well of Penelope's Star. After a hasty examination by an unqualified appraiser, the design was declared obsolete. The blueprint was auctioned off to a small mercenary organization known as the Free Star Combine, a militant subsidiary of the Ko Combine, and forgotten. 

Cycles later, the Free Star Combine finally built a prototype and begun weapon trials. The weapon was deemed too huge, difficult to mount in all but the largest craft, mediocre at best versus armored targets, and its range was anything but extraordinary. Nonetheless, the Mark IX stubbornly refused to be explained away by the theorists, as its raw damage output is impressive. These naysayers were quieted even further when secondary trials showed how utterly devastating the Mark IX is to shield generators.

The results of these trials did not remain secret for long, and the availability of the now common blueprints meant that the Mark IX was quickly manufactured to meet the demand in the Sector.",,,,
mjolnir,WEAPON,"A medium range cannon that delivers superior damage over time and also has a significant EMP payload.

A very advanced design, the Mjolnir is technically a magneto-gravitic shell projector, not a standard cannon. The micro capacitors within each shell are able to deliver enough energy to create a small-scale localized singularity. The built-in gravitic lens devastates all nearby matter, and creates the dreaded electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effect, disabling the target's weapons and systems. ",,,,
multineedler,WEAPON,"Fires multitudes of needles in a tight arc, creating a withering hail of projectiles that rip apart anything in their path. 

The Storm Needler is a flechette weapon, which fires caseless small-bore ammunition. Having reached the practical limits of medium sized cooling systems, the designers of caseless weapons blazed a path into the large weapon category with the Storm Needler's advanced nano coolant recyclers, per-barrel magnetized rifling and automated operation. An intelligent autoloader unpacks and loads just the right amount of ammunition from the magazines, allowing for nonstop operation provided adequate flux capacity.

The good range and speed of projectiles put a great strain on enemy shields, and can also be used effectively versus point defense threats.",,,,
hellbore,WEAPON,"A huge cannon which fires slow-moving plasma-charged projectiles. Rounds are highly effective versus armor and obliterate any hull structure left underneath.

A feared weapon platform, rarely deployed due to the complexity involved in manufacturing a built-up barrel that can safely fire enormous high-explosive shaped charge rounds. When such a shell impacts a target, the Neumann effect causes the warhead to propel a jet of molten metal into the target's armor, vaporizing a small area, causing hull breaches, depressurization, and extensive internal damage from the spall.",,,,
reaper,WEAPON,"A single unguided torpedo of devastating yield with a powerful on-board engine.

The quintessential strike weapon, a single Reaper torpedo is a large self-propelled, armored, unguided delivery system for an enriched AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead. The science behind the surprisingly compact detonator is poorly understood in the Sector though widely speculated to be based on physics classified as secret by Domain authority. What is known is that three or four of these slipping through PD arcs are enough to destroy even the largest capital ship.",,,,
atropos,WEAPON,"A rack of advanced guided torpedoes. The payload is smaller than usual to make room for the advanced guidance package and maneuvering system's reaction mass.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. Each rack mounts two torpedoes which can be fired separately, allowing strike captains maximum flexibility. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge.",,,,
atropos_single,WEAPON,"A single advanced, guided torpedo. The payload is smaller than usual to make room for the advanced guidance package and maneuvering system's reaction mass.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge.

This mount features only a single torpedo.",,,,
swarmer,WEAPON,"A short range guided missile launcher. The missiles are designed to intercept and destroy enemy fighters.

Launches bursts of small missiles. A simple infrared system provides effective tracking while chemical microthrusters provide exceptional maneuverability. Evolutionary targeting algorithms honed over centuries of real-world application allow the missiles to lead the target - they rarely miss and are very hard to avoid.",,,,
swarmer_fighter,WEAPON,A short range guided missile launcher. The missiles are designed to intercept and destroy enemy fighters.,,,,
annihilator,WEAPON,"Fires a spread of unguided rockets that cover a wide arc. Typically used to strip away enemy armor once shields are down.

Medium to long-range rockets launched from a small pod that fires five missiles per salvo in a narrow spread to improve the odds of hitting. Rockets are small and unguided, with the extra space being taken up by a larger warhead and improved propulsion systems, as well as thicker armor. 

Performs well against larger targets due to the higher chance of striking with multiple rockets. A rocket attack is often used as a screen before a torpedo strike to reduce the effectiveness of Point Defense systems. Takes several seconds to reload after a salvo.",,,,
annihilator_fighter,WEAPON,Fires a salvo of unguided rockets. Typically used to strip away enemy armor once shields are down.,,,,
annihilatorpod,WEAPON,"Fires a stream of unguided rockets. Useful for dealing with enemy armor, or - due to having no flux cost - applying sustained pressure.

Features the same medium to long-range rockets found on smaller launchers. Rockets are unguided, with the extra space being taken up by a larger warhead and improved propulsion systems, as well as thicker armor. 

Performs well against larger targets due to the higher chance of striking with multiple rockets. A rocket attack is often used as a screen before a torpedo strike to reduce the effectiveness of Point Defense systems. ",,,,
heatseeker,WEAPON,"Homes in on the target's engines and disables them with a powerful EMP burst. A combat-rated autoloader system ensures usefulness in protracted engagements.

The Salamander missile is a specialized weapon with two design considerations. The first is an extremely advanced tracking/targeting mechanism which enables it to home in on enemy engines, whilst avoiding all other potential impact points and Point Defense threats. 

The second is a special warhead design which, instead of attempting to destroy the target with kinetic or explosive force, generates targeted electromagnetic fields of high magnitude. When such a field is created in the proximity of unshielded engines and hull components, it will quickly knock out all their electronics, rendering them useless until repaired.",,,,
salamanderpod,WEAPON,"Homes in on the target's engines and disables them with a powerful EMP burst. A combat-rated autoloader system ensures usefulness in protracted engagements.

An externally mounted pod replaces the more common missile racks and allows two missiles to be fired almost simultaneously. An autoloader extracts, arms and primes the next salvo of two missiles after a short wait.

harpoon,WEAPON,"Medium range, high payload guided missile rack. Devastating against ships with downed shields.

Three-racked medium range missiles. An excellent propulsion system delivers a large warhead to the target at sublight speeds. Sacrificing maneuverability for speed and warhead size, the medium range missile is one of the highest yield non strike weapons employed in the Sector. One hit is almost fatal to frigate-sized ships.

This weapon system features a firing rack that houses multiple missiles.",,,,
harpoonpod,WEAPON,"Medium range, high payload guided missile pod. Devastating against ships with downed shields.

An externally mounted pod replaces the more common missile racks and allows multiple missiles to be fired almost simultaneously. An autoloader extracts, arms and primes the next salvo of missiles after a short wait.

These medium range missiles are identical to the ones fired from single or triple racks, and are a great way to finish off a ship with downed shields. An excellent propulsion system delivers a large warhead to the target at sublight speeds. Sacrificing maneuverability for speed and warhead size, the medium range missile is one of the highest yield non strike weapons employed in the sector. One hit is almost fatal to frigate-sized ships.

This mount can only launch one missile at a time, and carries a single replacement in a combat-rated magazine recessed into the hull.",,,,
sabot,WEAPON,"Fires a 2nd-stage spread of high-velocity kinetic penetrators when in range. Heavy damage to shields, and massive EMP damage when impacting on enemy hull or armor. Difficult to stop with PD.

Sabot-class class missiles are short-range, two-stage KE weapons. A guided missile first stage projects a secondary assembly to within striking distance of a shielded target. The on-board targeting computer then ignites the propellant for a KE penetrator. This 'sabot', as it is commonly called, is typically a narrow, laterally stabilized projectile manufactured from an ultra dense material such as depleted uranium.

Excellent at bringing down enemy shields and causing an overload. Standard ship armor is spaced and thus the sabot deals more manageable damage if shields are lowered in time to receive the impact on armor.

This weapon system features a firing rack that houses multiple missiles.",,,,

breach,WEAPON,"A heavily armored and fast missile with good guidance and a small, specialized anti-armor warhead.",,,,
breachpod,WEAPON,"A heavily armored and fast missile with good guidance and a small, specialized anti-armor warhead.",,,,
pilum,WEAPON,"A two-stage missile suited for long-range support by backline combat ships. The second stage has a higher top speed, giving it a better chance of defeating point-defense systems.

A technologically mature weapon system, the Pilum-class missile is the obvious choice for long-range strikes by cautious captains. The warhead consists of a device capable of causing spot failures in active shields, and an EMP generator to deliver a modest punch through these gaps. Neither device is particularly effective due to the constraints imposed by the missile's outsized fuel tanks.

The fire control system is linked and fires two Reaper-class torpedoes in tandem. An automatic loader prepares the next salvo from the magazine in seconds.",,,,
hurricane,WEAPON,"Launches a missile that splits into multiple warheads on closing with the target. Especially devastating to enemies with their shields down.

Hurricane Turrets are a late-Expansion Epoch weapon designed to launch a self-propelled, multiple missile delivery projector pod. A targeting computer programs the pod with a hit solution as it is released. The swarm of small missiles released is dangerous to all ship types. missiles feature a shaped charge warhead making them more effective versus enemy armor.

mininglaser,WEAPON,"Cheap utility laser that is hardwired for missile and fighter defense. This configuration gives it longer range than most point defense weapons.

A Mk I mining laser features a fluoride gas gain medium refitted for combat. The micro-asteroid targeting package has been repurposed to track and target incoming missiles. Mostly useless for anything larger or armored targets. Has a built-in 670nm tracker beam.",,,,
pdlaser,WEAPON,"Small laser designed for missile and fighter defense, with great tracking capability, decent damage and very short range.

Simplicity, reliability and low flux costs characterize this ubiquitous point-defense weapon. The laser is built around a carbon dioxide gain medium combined with a short range marker beam. A simple one stage lens assembly with no moving parts permits the weapon to operate for extended periods without maintenance procedures. Low damage has prompted the creation of the ""Pray [it's a] Dud"" Laser backronym.",,,,
taclaser,WEAPON,"Standard combat laser, useful at medium to long-ranges. A very flexible weapon, especially effective against unshielded targets.

The workhorse of beam weapons in the sector, the tactical laser is often used because of its low maintenance cost, versatility and ease of construction. Features a standard carbon dioxide gain medium, a 670nm marker beam and three lens assemblies. A good support weapon for small craft, especially in prolonged engagements.",,,,
ioncannon,WEAPON,"A medium range energy cannon that delivers an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and can quickly disable enemy systems/engines. May arc to modules near the point of impact.

The Ion Cannon's nonstandard gain medium projects highly-ionized baryonic matter in a coherent bolt. When the ion bolt impacts the target it creates a localized magnetic field which plays havoc with all manner of electronics, including sensors, fuel igniters, targeting modules, computers, etc. The weapon also fuses certain circuits, and can mildly strain shield generators, thus it does negligible amount of permanent damage. Rarely the only weapon type fitted on ships.",,,,

irpulse,WEAPON,"A flux-efficient infrared pulse laser which fires bolts of energy at medium range. An excellent weapon for prolonged bursts of fire.

This weapon is identical to most combat lasers with a carbon dioxide gain medium fired at eleven microns. A q-switched power supply permits ablation of the target which makes the weapon much more effective than a conventional beam, at the cost of much higher power consumption. Most often used on fighters or frigates, where the low range of the weapon can be offset by the maneuverability of the fitted craft.",,,,

lrpdlaser,WEAPON,"Medium range energy weapon, effective at neutralizing missile and fighter threats. Can be fired for extended periods, but the damage is subpar.

An additional lens assembly eliminates self-diffusing particles from a standard carbon dioxide beam fired at a wavelength of eleven microns. The extended range permits the otherwise low wattage to have a greater impact on the targets. Particularly useful in destroying missiles headed for a shielded target - a standard point defense laser generally doesn't have the range to extend far enough past the defensive shields of the ship it is supposed to protect.",,,,
pdburst,WEAPON,"Features a built-in capacitor that lets the weapon fire several bursts in quick succession if allowed to fully recharge. Excellent vs missiles and fighters.

The burst point defense laser is a further refinement of standard PD beam weapons. The q-switched gain medium is pulse pumped, ensuring that the power delivered to the titanium-doped sapphire gain medium peaks at a predefined interval. The result is a weapon that fires once every couple of seconds and is extremely effective for its small size. Power consumption is small enough that even some fighter craft power cores can handle the firing load.",,,,

amblaster,WEAPON,"A slow-firing, extremely high damage energy gun meant to pose a threat to the largest ships in the Sector. Can only be used at close-range.

The antimatter blaster is one of the most complicated weapons in existence. Antimatter is stored in shells that have their own powered magnetic field projector built into the casing. In order to generate a field strong enough to contain and eject the antimatter (typically positrons) the built-in capacitor must spend a considerable time charging. Once a magnetic field of the required strength is generated, the shell is breached and the antimatter is ejected toward the target, its main propellant being the Lorentz force around the muzzle of the blaster. 

Extremely effective versus all targets.",,,,
phasebeam,WEAPON,"A short-range, short-duration beam that causes heavy damage in a burst. Capable against armor, as far as beam weapons go.

This weapon is, at base, simply a laser beam with a tripled sapphire gain medium to ensure the highest possible weaponized wavelengths. The photons are fired through a hyperdimensional filter which outputs an energy beam that exists partially in p-space. The physics of the filter are not properly understood, and in laboratory settings the p-space components of a beam exceeding 6.66 giga-watts will sometimes flicker - as if blocked. Weapon mounts never use such high energy levels to ensure reliability.",,,,
gravitonbeam,WEAPON,"An atypical beam weapon which is highly effective versus shields. Excellent range, but the damage per second ratio vs armor is sub-par.

The core of this weapon is a brane rift generator which follows a 500nm tracer beam. The beam prepares local space-time for the rift in addition to providing targeting feedback to manual operators. 

Once the rift is open, higher-brane gravitons enter local space time en masse and persist up to 100 centiseconds. Damage to the target is caused by the resulting intense gravimetric shear. These higher-brane gravitons easily overwhelm standard energy fields.",,,,
pulselaser,WEAPON,"Fires repeating bolts of energy, favoring the medium-range combatant that has the flux reserves and wants to put constant pressure on the enemy.

Designed to fire pulses rather than a constant beam, with a total power output exceeding constant-operation designs. As with continuous lasers, a carbon dioxide gain medium is fed energy and produces photons at eleven microns wavelengths. 

Greater energy delivered in shorter time means the target is ablated, a process that causes the vaporization of small surfaces sections. The resulting shock waves do additional structural damage. ",,,,
miningblaster,WEAPON,"The miner's best friend, this weapon can deliver pulverizing bolts of energy at medium range, albeit at extreme cost in flux.",,,,
heavyblaster,WEAPON,"Fires bolts of energy at enemy targets. With high damage and flux costs, the heavy blaster is one of the most damaging weapons for its size.

A reliable energy weapon, the Heavy Blaster uses improved high-energy gas ammunition which, when activated by a strong electric current, is converted into plasma. A guiding electron is fired along the axis of traversal beforehand, ensuring that the uncontained plasma bolt will travel in the intended direction, thanks to physics that are no longer well understood.",,,,
heavyburst,WEAPON,"A heavier version of the PD Burst Laser, this weapon features a longer range and a greater number of built-in capacitors for higher up-front damage.

An often underestimated weapon, the heavy burst laser is actually one of the best performing beam weapons available in the Sector. A cursory examination of the gain medium and lens housing is often enough to assure even the most skeptical inspector that the technology housed within is some of the best the Domain had to offer. 

The physics that create the burst effect are not understood by the highest echelons of the Hegemony Armaments Committee or even the Tri-Tachyon Hybrid Physics Division. It is theorized that a q-switched multi-phased beam could be shot through a quantum filter which would ensure entanglement and create a burst effect. This may be an explanation for the tripled lens housing, originally thought to be a failsafe system. But these are just theories. 

In combat, the Heavy Burst Laser is favored by those that want be assured that their point defense perimeter is state-of-the-art.",,,,
plasma,WEAPON,"A large, arcane weapon that's one of the most devastating sustained damage-dealers in the Sector, provided the ship it's mounted on can handle the flux it generates.

Plasma cannons are related to graviton and phase beams, in that they use poorly-documented properties of brane physics to deliver their payloads. A plasma cannon shell is a microfusion bomb which uses gravitic and baryonic lens to focus its energy inward. The resulting explosion creates plasma which is contained by a temporary mini-universe anomaly, while magnetic drivers mounted on the forward pylons accelerate it toward the target. The containment field lasts only a couple seconds, which is usually long enough for the anomaly to reach a target. If the convex hull of the field is not breached by ordinary matter/energy delivering at least 9 kN, the higher brane will absorb the destructive plasma, and it will vanish from our dimension forever. ",,,,
hil,WEAPON,"A long-range, high damage beam weapon, often mounted on support ships, or ships that need anti-armor capability on a budget.

The High Intensity Laser is a powerhouse weapon that has an energy rating well beyond the giga-watt range. To produce such power for an extended period of time, the design relies on a built-in fusion power core. This core still requires an external actuator, a role filled by a ship's reactor when firing commences. 

Three meticulously calibrated lens assemblies guide photons within the ignition unit, requiring seconds to build up the energy necessary to maintain a coherent beam. The gain medium is a two-staged gas-solid which is q-switched and provides a potent particle stream that can obliterate unsuspecting targets in seconds.

The extreme range at which targets can be tracked and destroyed makes the HIL excel in safely providing close support to friendly ships that are engaged in a melee. It is a favored weapon of captains that can manage the flux cost associated with operating it.",,,,
autopulse,WEAPON,"Numerous built-in capacitors are at the core of this extremely efficient, yet potent energy weapon. The high burst damage from expending built-up charges is offset by the comparatively low sustained firing rate.",,,,
guardian,WEAPON,"A collection of smaller lasers mounted together on a rotating pod, with a built-in capacitor allowing extremely high burst damage vs fighters and missiles.

The Paladin is a military grade PD system that is usually only deployed on capital ships due to its high production and flux costs. Can detect and destroy incoming strike weapons and enemy fighters that have penetrated the capital ship's defensive escort screen. 

A combination of an autonomous sub-gamma AI core for targeting and five separate carbon dioxide lasers make this weapon exceptionally effective in point defense. A dedicated rotator power supply makes target tracking almost instantaneous. The prohibitive energy requirement usually means that the weapon is only activated for seconds at a time, but that is usually enough to deal with any PD threat.",,,,
tpc,WEAPON,"A bulky energy weapon from an early epoch, the TPC is built directly into the Onslaught's hull and provides overwhelming frontal firepower.

Designed before modular energy weapons were universally trusted by Domain naval architects, this weapon was coded into the Onslaught's blueprint because no other hull of the time was large enough or had reactors capable of generating the requisite power.

Even though it's outperformed by some of the later epoch modular designs, the Thermal Pulse Cannon remains an integral part of the Onslaught's arsenal.",,,,
tachyonlance,WEAPON,"A burst operated beam that delivers a devastating amount of damage with a cascading EMP component. The EMP arcs have a chance to pass through shields based on the target's hard flux level.

A weapon so rare and powerful that it has achieved mythical status in the Sector, the Tachyon Lance uses core technology based on the principles of an experimental FTL communication system prototype, but with a twist. Instead of using the hyperdimensional properties of the tachyon particle for communication, n-brane manipulation and anti-plasma generators create a charged tachyon stream that travels in hyperspace. Minimum energy requirements are staggering and this amount of power can only be generated for a few seconds by the largest power capacitors, which are housed within the weapon system. 

Unlike the beams fired from normal beam weapons, the tachyon stream is not lensed or altered in any way - in fact once the initial tachyon marker is actuated the reaction takes on a life of its own, rapidly consuming the power stored in the capacitors and unleashing destruction. When normal space is exposed to such high levels of anti-plasma, a combined electromagnetic, gravitic and thermal cavitation effect shreds anything that stands in its way, while also severely damaging nearby electronics equipment.",,,,
onslaught,SHIP,"A venerable design, the Onslaught-class battleships were first created to serve the Domain Armada long ago, before the development of advanced strike weapons, modern energy weapons, and shield systems. 

When first launched from orbital dock, they must have surely dwarfed any other ship in existence and intimidated entire systems. Some even say that they were built to combat non-humans in a long forgotten war. Much later, Domain engineers made modifications to the blueprints to include a shield system, upgraded the FTL drives, and reduced the necessary crew complement through automation and iterative engineering. Even though more advanced blueprints are available, the Onslaught remains the easiest to manufacture due to the brutal simplicity of its systems. 

A ship designed without shields in mind, built to be able to withstand a heavy barrage of enemy fire and strike back while protecting its crew is much loved by its officers and crew. And strike back it can; the Onslaught's unmatched ballistic potential can devastate entire fleets in minutes, its only drawback a logistical dependency on ammunition. 

The Onslaught-class proudly serves as the backbone of the Hegemony Navy.",,,,
astral,SHIP,"A technologically advanced capital ship designed primarily as a carrier, the Astral-class is able to project vast amounts of firepower through its numerous fighter craft squadrons.

The Astral-class ships are thought to have been the epitome of carrier design in the Domain during the years prior to the Collapse. Nearly all systems that can be automated are, with each handled by sophisticated (but not too sophisticated) sub-AI cores installed throughout the ship. Defensive weapon systems are typically, but not always, point defense turrets and long-range missiles. 

The true power of an Astral lies in its fighter craft, which give the carrier unprecedented flexibility in the battle space. Nearly any enemy ship type that appears on the captain's scopes can quickly be dispatched, given just a launch order of a wing of nimble interceptors, strike bombers or fighters. Automated facilities ensure that a squadron coming back from a mission can quickly be repaired and rearmed behind the safety of the powerful X-35 shield emitter. The Astral-class is very vulnerable should the X-35 come down. This is why when not protected by its fighter wings it never travels alone, but instead is at the head of space-borne carrier fleets. These task forces are a rarity, as the power they hold is usually required to subjugate entire planets or blockade enormous areas of space.

The Astral is perhaps the most technologically advanced capital ship that can be seen in the Sector today. Few serve with the Hegemony due to the high technological requirements that it imposes on orbital docks. Senior Naval Corporate Officers of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation or extremely wealthy private admirals sometimes make an Astral their flagship.",,,,
atlas,SHIP,"The Atlas-class ships are large space-borne cargo platforms with an FTL drive and a few defensive systems. Hundreds of containers can be latched on to the hull and carried with ease by this behemoth. 

Typically used to efficiently resupply entire outposts, the Atlas is ill suited to the small and fast trade runs that are the mainstay of commerce in the sector. Their slow speed and large size always tempt uninvited guests, ranging from curious gawkers come to see the hulking colossus, to scavenging pirates aiming to disable a container's magneto-gravitic fastener, to Pather fanatics bent on destroying it all. Nonetheless, the Hegemony makes wide use of them, especially to offload biomass from farming worlds on a seasonal basis. For this purpose, the Hegemony assembles large Atlas convoys; these are protected by military cruisers that ensure that the lifeline of Hegemony citizens is kept safe.

The captaincy of an Atlas is a rare punishment for the able, an uneven mixture of soul-numbing boredom and abject terror, being the results of normal trade runs and pirate attacks, respectively.",,,,
conquest,SHIP,"The Conquest-class battlecruiser is the embodiment of concentrated firepower. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that new weapons systems would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. So why not build a ship for speed and power? Give it the armor protection of a cruiser, but arm it with the best weapons available to any ship, and have it remain faster than any of those lumbering behemoths of the line. The Conquest is a good example of these concepts put into a hull. Many other advanced technologies were incorporated into the design, including weapon mounts designed for a circling engagement. This maneuver requires greater navigational skill while serving to provide more tactical options to the commanding officers. 

Fortune favors the bold, the ancients said. This class of ships does indeed favor the bold captain, willing to risk everything for the thrill of victory.",,,,
paragon,SHIP,"The pinnacle of the Domain's battleship designs, though perhaps less the result of military necessity and more of the ambitions of certain senior strategic staff of the Domain Navy - with considerable backing from the Tri-Tachyon corporation, among other major contractors.

No ship can outlast or outgun the Paragon-class, a true Leviathan of a bygone epoch.",,,,
odyssey,SHIP,"The asymmetric, spheroid design belies the power of this battlecruiser. The base hull presents a loadout which favors heavy energy weapons and mobility-focus. A two-wing hangar capacity complements tactical options.

The Odyssey was considered a boondoggle of a design by the Domain Naval Procurement Committee with numerous objections raised: no single tactical focus, the officer boardrooms are too large, the energy grid uses only premium components, and the fittings are too expensive. Despite several rounds of eye-watering budget overruns and rumblings of a bribery scandal, the production contract was only denied before final prototype trials. Never keen to pass up a profitable opportunity, Altair Exotech licensed the Odyssey class to several frontier development corporations, including Eridani-Utopia, to provide admirably armed mobile survey headquarters and operation platforms. It is for this role in the megacorporate exploitation of the frontiers that the otherwise rare Odyssey-class found its way to the Persean Sector.",,,,
dominator,SHIP,"Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. 

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents. ",,,,
aurora,SHIP,"The Aurora-class cruiser is a technological marvel, rarely seen. Among the fastest and most maneuverable cruisers in the Sector, it is also one of the safest due to its wide shield coverage. 

One can only wonder what the Domain Navy could accomplish with a fleet of these sleek, asymmetric, and eminently effective vessels. The shields are backed up by hyper-advanced flux dissipation systems installed throughout the hull, which gives the Aurora a deep flux pool.

Most blueprints required to manufacture Aurora-class ships are closely guarded corporate secrets, but a few have also seen service in Tri-Tachyon fleets and, rarely, in the hands of enterprising mercenary captains.

Few ships can outperform the Aurora ton for ton. Its only weakness is its prohibitive cost.",,,,
apogee,SHIP,"The Apogee-class vessel is an effective mix of advanced scientific and military technologies, perfect for long-range exploration of hostile space. 

The class features an asymmetric design with a large forward section, usually outfitted with long-range tech scanners. Apogee captains are used to operating alone and tend to be an independent, self-reliant lot. 

The ship can hold its own in one-on-one engagements by smart use of its powerful shield emitter and strong engines. However, its armor rating makes it seem somewhat fragile on paper, and thus it is rarely part of big fleet actions.

The high construction costs typically mean that only affluent tech mining consortiums can afford an Apogee-class vessel that is fully outfitted for an aggressive exploratory role.",,,,
venture,SHIP,"Tough, dependable and not overly expensive, Venture-class cruisers are usually constructed by private corporations for escort duty or by small non-aligned worlds for system defense.

The Venture-class ships are perhaps the most widely used civilian cruisers in the Sector. The blueprints for the Venture are widely available and can often be secured without too much trouble. 

When used by small corporations, the ship is usually the pride of the fleet and is used to underpin vital operations. Due to its ubiquity, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship.","Tough and dependable, the Venture is usually fitted with a good missile complement but lacks the sustained damage output needed to do well in prolonged engagements. A built-in mining drone bay provides additional defenses - a particularly good thing because the civilian-grade power generators make the shields easy to overwhelm.",,,
eagle,SHIP,"Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ","Agile for a cruiser, the Eagle is difficult to flank and has impressive and focused frontal firepower.",,,
falcon,SHIP,"Often called the Eagle cruiser's little brother, the Falcon-class cruiser sacrifices armor for speed, neatly filling the light cruiser role in military fleets throughout the Sector. 

The ""light"" designation does not indicate a significant reduction in firepower, however, making the Falcon a valuable tactical asset to any fleet. The ship is easily able to fill a wide variety of roles, from close support to assault, given the proper configuration. 

The Falcon's top notch engines give it the ability to quickly disengage from battle should its defenses be pressed to a critical point.

Swift and elegant, Falcon-class cruisers are often found as lead elements in larger fleet formations, or deployed to reinforce anti-pirate convoys.","This light cruiser features mobility that puts smaller ships to shame, but its firepower is somewhat lacking. However, the Falcon can still face down smaller ships due to its cruiser-grade power generators and armor plating.",,,
medusa,SHIP,"A fearsome ship whose top tier engines provide great speed and maneuverability for a destroyer. Multiple energy weapon slots allow for a plethora of tactical possibilities. Its best-in-class performance is matched by a demanding logistical profile that has led some fleet commanders to eschew its use in favor of other ships that can be deployed more frequently and cheaply.

The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the sector due to its association with black ops and elite pirates. The few that have been aboard a Medusa can attest to its extreme level of technological sophistication. Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are some of the rarest and most closely guarded data in the Sector.

Deemed too expensive to mass produce by most corporations and governments, it is rarely employed by the lawful authorities as a black ops cruiser. On the rarest occasion, a Medusa-class hull may fall into the hands of pirates. The usual results are a drastic reduction in system small to medium shipping, which puts a strain on most planetary and outpost economies.

Sector naval tacticians have few answers for the threat that the Medusa presents.",,,,
shrike,SHIP,"An advanced fast-attack light destroyer from the same design team as the near-ubiquitous Wolf, the Shrike's advanced propulsion system is designed to selectively vent plasma in a 'microburn' maneuver. This allows the Shrike to dart into tactical opportunities as they arise, strike, and escape before a proper counter-attack is mounted. Shields, armour, and sustained flux capacity are somewhat underwhelming due to the need to build a light yet economical hull which prioritizes attack speed, leading to the Shrike gaining the reputation as a glass cannon best entrusted to skilled captains.

Certain unique structural elements in the plasma venting system are known to, with wear, corrode in oxygen-rich atmospheres, so care must be taken to re-apply ceramopolymer coating at each hull servicing.",,,,
mule,SHIP,"The Mule is a rugged and reliable combat-capable freighter which built its reputation on the sparsely-patrolled frontiers of the Domain. Post-collapse, the Mule's appeal only grown through the cycles of chaos which wrack the Persean Sector and elevate the importance of strong armor and powerful weapons to otherwise thrifty traders, scavengers, and prospectors.

The original design officially designated its medium turret mount as a 'gimbaled mining utility attachment point', and even Domain operators from time past knew to read between the lines: without an escort, the Mule-class packs enough of a kick to make pirates think twice before attacking. Of course this also means that the Mule has become the ideal vehicle for a down-on-its-luck or merely opportunistic civilian crew to themselves turn pirate.",,,,
buffalo2,SHIP,"A derived class, based on the Buffalo freighter. The modifications include the addition of military grade power generators, heavier armor, and maneuvering thrusters as well as the removal of the Mk. I shield emitter and the majority of the cargo holds.

The Sector is violent and unpredictable, and conflicts often flare up over the smallest resource or perceived slight. In such situations military-grade ships are sometimes not available quickly enough. Thus, resourceful engineers turn to hull modifications in order to be able to meet the demand for war materiel.

The base hull of this destroyer is a standard Buffalo-class freighter, however due to the scope of the hull conversion, the Buffalo Mk. II is considered a separate class. The result is a fighting ship which can hold its own and fight back hard, especially if properly screened from strikes and heavier hulls. The unorthodox weapons configuration often leads to unique fleet formations, and hull modifications often mean that no two Buffalo Mk. IIs are quite the same.

The tactics employed by a Buffalo Mk. II captain will vary as much as his hull configuration, but rarely involve standing toe-to-toe with anything heavier than a frigate due to the lack of a shield generator and energy weapon emplacements. The combat plans usually involve a one hit wonder stratagem that never works on the same enemy twice, which is perfectly fine with the crew of the Buffalo Mk. II.",,,,
valkyrie,SHIP,"The Valkyrie is a standard destroyer-sized troop transport with enough room to carry two companies of marines. Tactically it is weak for its size, only able to defend itself at short ranges from missiles and fighters.

As an atmosphere-capable combat dropship with ground support weapon mounts designed to operate during re-entry and when grounded, the Valkyrie is often used to deploy heavy infantry support for tech raids on decivilized worlds. 

The ability to deliver large amounts of troops directly to ground targets while providing fire support prompted Hegemony bureaucrats to designate the hull as ""restricted"" for sale to third parties. Naturally, news of the restriction made it to the general public cycles before it came into effect, launching ill-fated speculation in the future prices of this class. Thus, overproduction and the hull's limited options made the speculator's activities bets largely moot, the only net result is that now, due to oversupply, it is just as easy to obtain a Valkyrie ship as before news of the Hegemony ban ever became public.",,,,
tarsus,SHIP,"Tarsus-class ships are well known as perhaps the most flexible and durable freighters in the Sector. 

The secret to their reliability is that they were intended by Domain designers as hazard duty ships, presumably to supply frontiers and those front line fleets send to quash the ever-present rumbling of insurrection on the far reaches of the Domain.

Almost unmatched among civilian ships in bulkhead structural density and armor rating, Tarsus-class freighters are entrusted with important hauls and usually travel in convoys, a further buttress to the safety they afford to their crew and cargo.

Minimal weapon mounts permit the ship to mount a nominal PD weapons package. Rarely, Tarsus-class ships are outfitted with combat oriented hull or armor boosting modifications, which make them more difficult to maintain.",,,,
gemini,SHIP,"A common freighter, found in convoys or alone, used to haul all manner of goods across the Sector. Has a single fighter bay to bolster defenses.

The design of the Gemini-class freighter is highly modular, enabling the ship to serve in a variety of roles in and out of combat. The entire cargo container is designed around a quick release mechanism which enables the main hull of the ship to quickly call to port, detach its full cargo section, and swap it for another Gemini-type container in the span of minutes. In addition, multiple medium weapon mounts make the Gemini a viable long-range fire support platform. The flight deck is tiny, and was original envisioned for mining drone repair or hazardous mining operations. Modern use in the Sector extends flight deck facilities to all fighter types.

While impressive in a blueprint, the lack of empty, compatible Gemini-type containers in the Sector makes the actual usefulness of the quick-release mechanism negligible. The modularity, a great boon in times past is also more prone to wear and tear, and is thus more expensive to maintain - most working examples of the mechanisms have been welded solid. Nonetheless, a decent overall profile, the flight deck, a flexible power core and good shields make the Gemini a good choice for cargo hauling, if the cost can be weathered.",,,,
shuttlepod,SHIP,"A tiny, nimble personnel-transfer shuttle just sufficient to transport the senior bridge officers of any ship in the Sector.",,,,
buffalo,SHIP,"The go-to choice for medium cargo hauling in the Sector, the Buffalo-class freighter exemplifies the ""Load-n-Pray"" principle prevalent in Sector shipping.

Sporting just a single small weapon emplacement, the hull of the ship is no more than a large engine with a tiny crew quarters section and cargo grapplers. A captain taking this ship out without a convoy rarely gets to make the same mistake twice. Incapable of anything resembling a combat maneuver, the lateral thrusters on Buffalo-class ships are designed to merely enable it to dock when (and if) it reaches its destination.

The ship engines are the greatest contributor to hull cost, which, while low, is still within the norms for a medium freighter. The greatest contributing factor to its ubiquity is the fact that the blueprint for this ship is usually hardcoded into every orbital shipyard's blueprint database.",,,,
enforcer,SHIP,"The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. 

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony Logisticarum bureaucrats.",,,,
condor,SHIP,"The Condor-class sees heavy service in the Sector as this carrier-converted freighter is, for many independent polities, the easiest way to procure fighter capability for their organization. Even with limited flight deck space, the Condor gets the job done, relying on its tough armor, excellent bulkhead strength, and a respectable (for a light carrier) weapons package.

This light carrier design is derived from Tarsus-class freighters modified by desperate scavengers and pirates. The conversion process was once an involved and complex affair requiring space dock facilities, but nowadays any hull-capable forge that will accept a stock Tarsus spec will, with the addition of a custom modchip, get you something just as good.

Some in the Sector argue that even the Domain, with all their technological know-how, relied on similar conversions to make more efficient use of a merchant fleet during times of escalated hostilities on the voluminous galactic frontier. Others point out that it is unclear how ubiquitous this approach was - there could have been fleets of Condors roaming Domain space, but there is scarce hard evidence one way or the other. Such data was all lost in the Collapse.",,,,
sunder,SHIP,A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assault frigates.,,,,
hammerhead,SHIP,"A midline destroyer from the golden age of the Domain, the Hammerhead is respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities.",,,,
phaeton,SHIP,"A medium tanker with enough fuel capacity to support a larger fleet. Tanker duty is often considered punitive in the Hegemony - there's little opportunity for distinction, and less chance of survival should direct contact with the enemy occur.",,,,
crig,SHIP,"Originally designed to assist in assembling large ships and orbital installations, the salvage rig's gantry and manipulators are used to assist in recovering derelict hulks and scavenging useful material from wreckage and debris fields. The rig itself has no cargo or fuel capacity and requires ample supply to maintain. Increases non-combat salvage gained, with more difficult operations being able to make use of more rigs.",,,,
prometheus,SHIP,"A tanker of vast capacity used to shift strategic quantities of fuel between worlds. Unlike its smaller cousins, the Prometheus features a reasonable defensive arsenal to protect its valuable and volatile cargo.",,,,
monitor,SHIP,"An oddity among ships, the Monitor is the result of the line of thought that sometimes the best defense is indeed the best defense. Features turret mounts angled to provide wide arcs and a unique flux shunt modification to its power systems specially constructed to relieve flux generated by shields. Indeed, the Monitor makes up for a lack of maneuverability and firepower with the ability to withstand prolonged bombardment from enemy ordnance.

Though its experimental nature is perhaps a sign of the innovation that eras of turmoil seem to inspire, whether the Monitors radical defensive focus is a boon or pitfall remains contentious. Several dramatic failures in convoy protection patrols were explained by Ko Combine PR representatives to be the fault of improper tactics employed by convoy commanders. Ko Combine maintains that when positioned correctly in a combat situation and supported by strike-craft - as the anvil and hammer, respectively - simulations demonstrate that the Monitor significantly enhances convoy survivability against the average pirate attack. Prominent critics remain.",,,,
cerberus,SHIP,"The Cerberus is prized for providing a cost-effective balance between cargo capacity and enough combat power for its size to discourage casual piracy with the happy result of lowered insurance rates compared to standard Domain-era civilian grade freighters. The Cerberus is now widely considered to be a wise choice for independent traders in the Sector. 

In times past, before the fall of the gate system when Domain authority reigned, combat-enabled freighters like the Cerberus found only niche use on the edges of the rare warzone or in especially uncivilized hinterlands of the galaxy where Domain Armada patrols were stretched thinly. The crew combat training, weapon maintenance, and mass/thrust ratio loss caused by heavier armour were viewed as causing unnecessary cost overhead. But this is a new age filled with both danger and profitable opportunities; the abilities of the Cerberus have given the hull a new life in the trade lanes.",,,,
heron,SHIP,"The Heron provides the strategic and tactical mobility of a cruiser with potential firepower limited only by available strike-craft. It is the perfect accompaniment to the quick-moving and hard-hitting fleet of an admiral who knows when to take the initiative, hit quickly, and withdraw while enemy forces are still responding to the threat.

Historically the Heron represented a movement in Domain Armada strategy from a heavy capital ship doctrine based on overwhelming firepower toward a focus on strike craft and support cruisers that enable sufficient firepower to be quickly focused on weak points, a strategic shift that would reverse itself as a natural reaction against tradition from each successive generation of Armada officers. This process was occurring once more in the cycles immediately preceding the fall of the gate system and, in something of a coup for the so-called Cruiser School, the forward-thinking Altair Exotech won the Heron design contract over the traditional manufacturer of heavy Armada warships, Orion Shipyards. 

However the doctrinal shift embodied by the Heron was interrupted by the isolation of The Fall, and as such it is not often found in core Hegemony fleets (whose officers still cling to tradition). This hull has however found great popularity among the independent worlds, megacorporations, and mercenary forces of the Sector that tend to field leaner, faster fleets.",,,,
drover,SHIP,"The Drover is a hull designed by the Cruiser-school-dominated Domain Naval Procurement Committee to provide a strategically versatile (though tactically limited) fighter platform with low logistical overhead. The fighter complement of the Drover is unmatched for its size. Command of a Drover is considered something of a test of character for junior officers: Will they use fearsome alpha-strike potential to seize victory in a sudden attack or hold back and use its threat to curtail aggressive moves by the opposition?

The contract for design of the Drover was won by Orion Shipyards, the traditional Armada ship-builder, in an effort to recover lost market share from the newer naval producers. The result was the 'flying landing strip' maligned by Domain officers as a command more fitting for a logistics bureaucrat than a fighting ship-captain. Complaints in the lower ranks were used by the old Capital-school faction to send the Drover back to committee, citing insufficient firepower for the ship class to meet standard guidelines (which did not account for the strike potential of new classes of fighters). Set up to take the fall for a massive overspend, the committee simply ordered an enormous number of simple missile hardpoints installed- this met the firepower requirements handily and allowed the Drover programme to proceed with only minor alteration.",,,,
hermes,SHIP,"The Hermes is a small, dependable cargo hauler often converted for transport duty among poor frontier worlds. Its crew and passenger facilities are charitably described as ""robust"" but it manages to get the job done with remarkable consistency despite the primitive maintenance facilities it frequents.

Factory-spec, the Hermes is armed only for ""active collision avoidance"", but its turret system is often upgraded to achieve nearly full albeit light point-defense coverage that can destroy the stray missile while escaping from active combat zones. This firepower is meagre compared to dedicated combat ships so only a mad or truly desperate captain would employ the Hermes in front line combat.",,,,
ox,SHIP,"The Ox-class tug carries a drive field stabilizer that allows a fleet to reach a higher burn level. It's rare to see more than one or two of these in a fleet, however, due to prohibitive fuel consumption and high maintenance costs.",,,,
dram,SHIP,A light tanker with enough fuel capacity to more than double the effective range of a small task force or convoy.,,,,
vigilance,SHIP,"An excellent harasser and support frigate, the Vigilance-class has oversized (for its class) energy and missile mounts. While it shines in a fleet setting, it can be easily overwhelmed by large numbers of smaller threats.",,,,
brawler,SHIP,"Typically deployed to beef up system police forces and port authority security, the Brawler-class frigate is a robust design which trades mobility (and comfort) for impressive firepower, armor, and a destroyer-grade power generator.",,,,
tempest,SHIP,"An asymmetric, advanced design from the late Expansion Epoch, the Tempest-class is the quintessential attack frigate - fast, deadly and difficult to destroy.",,,,
omen,SHIP,The Omen is rarely deployed due to the cost associated with maintaining such a technologically advanced ship. Its excellent shields and the EMP Emitter it carries make it a perfect escort for larger ships.,,,,
lasher,SHIP,"A favorite of pirates and private armies due to the ubiquity of the blueprints and its non-demanding support profile, Lasher-class frigates pack a respectable amount of ballistic firepower.

Lasher captains are usually no-nonsense types who let their weapons do the talking, and pick through the debris of enemy ships as opposed to trying more diplomatic or covert means of getting the job done. More often than not, that job involves quickly and effectively striking at (or guarding) small or medium-sized trade convoys. The light fighter and frigate escorts usually found guarding such convoys are hardly a match for the hail of projectiles a Lasher can quickly unleash. If that does not get the job done, the Lasher has another nasty surprise in wait - two missile hardpoints, more often than not fitted with ""finisher"" types of missile, such as the Harpoon MRM.",,,,
mercury,SHIP,"One of the smallest ships in the Sector equipped with an on-board hyperdrive actuator, this class is typically used for safely transporting VIPs or couriers between star systems.

Although small, the Shuttle-class is outfitted for the comfort and security of its potential VIP passengers. It is rare to see one in combat; if a captain is unlucky enough to be in such a spot, one can quickly see why: most power systems on board are reserved for use by the life support, comfort and entertainment modules, installed to make sure that passengers do not get bored on long voyages.",,,,
hyperion,SHIP,"A bleeding-edge advanced gunship built around a unique phase teleportation system. The finicky integrated prototype power grid is tricky and expensive to maintain but delivers excellent flux and shield performance. The Hyperion was built to 'punch up', using tactical positioning to pick its fights then engage with a relatively heavy weapon weapon loadout for its class, mounted at the expense of point defense capability.

Considered a 'hangar queen', the Hyperion is scorned by quartermasters yet prized by Tri-Tachyon fleet directors who admire the purity of the ambition which can be felt throughout its design and application.",,,,
hound,SHIP,"An old but durable hull class that lacks a shield generator, this frigate is sometimes used to ferry cargo instead of for combat duty. A lucky or gifted officer could make his fortune given the chance to captain one.",,,,
wolf,SHIP,"A technologically advanced frigate with an efficient shield generator and an impressive weapons package that allows it to punch far above its weight. These same characteristics mean its frigate-grade power core struggles to keep up, making careful flux management a priority.",,,,
thunder,SHIP,"Extremely fast, well-armed, and with a long engagement range, the Thunder's strength lies in enabling a carrier to rapidly project force at the desired location. Not as damaging as a bomber or as tough as a heavy fighter, it will falter if forced into a prolonged engagement.",,,,
warthog,SHIP,"Boasting superb armor with firepower to match, the Warthog is capable of trading blows with larger ships, but lacks shield-breaking weapons. A decoy flare launcher helps draw fire away from its more vulnerable allies.",,,,
gladius,SHIP,"Fast, deadly and well-armored, the Gladius excels at improving both the firepower and survivability of interceptor groups. However, when facing durable opponents, the small number of craft in a wing begins to tell.",,,,
mining_drone,SHIP,"Sturdy and uncrewed, the Mining Pod can provide a bit of a distraction and a bit of fire support, and not much else. Incapable of operating away from the mothership.",,,,
longbow,SHIP,"Fast and equipped with a shield generator, the Longbow's job is to deploy its kinetic Sabot missile from range and return to the carrier to rearm. Most effective when its shield-breaking kinetic damage is combined with that of heavier damage-dealers.",,,,
trident,SHIP,"Equipped with dual Atropos-class torpedoes and a top-notch shield generator, the Trident is perhaps the most feared of all bombers. Its effectiveness is somewhat limited by its low top speed and demanding logistical profile.",,,,
piranha,SHIP,"The Piranha deploys unpowered conventional bombs en masse, relying on momentum to deliver the payloads. The maximum damage potential is extreme, but most targets can either avoid or shoot down many of the bombs.",,,,
broadsword,SHIP,"Tough and agile, the Broadsword carries a decoy flare launcher that draws defensive fire away from high-value targets like bombers and their payloads. However, it can falter if faced with the need to deal the killing blow itself.",,,,
xyphos,SHIP,"Heavily shielded and armed with long range weapons, the Xyphos is highly effective in a close support role. Its reliance on targeting and navigation feeds from larger ships mean it's incapable of operating independently.",,,,
wasp,SHIP,"Fast and nimble, Wasp drones typically outnumber and easily swarm enemy fighter formations while their Stinger mines prevent stragglers from getting through. Faced with point-defense weaponry, their fragility begins to tell, but the lack of a pilot on board means losses are more easily absorbed.",,,,
dagger,SHIP,"Armed with a highly damaging torpedo, the Dagger is fragile but equipped with a shield generator that usually enables it to get within launch range. However, even a large torpedo barrage is unlikely to get through concentrated point-defense fire without a distraction.",,,,
talon,SHIP,"Fast and cheap, the Talon sports surprising firepower and is capable of dispatching enemy fighters. It can also deal appreciable damage to larger ships when used en masse, though such use usually results in heavy pilot losses.",,,,
hoplon,SHIP,"The Khopesh can deliver an accurate and devastating rocket barrage to its target. Safer and more reliable in dealing its damage than other bombers, it also doesn't boast quite the same damage potential.",,,,
claw,SHIP,"Nimble and equipped with a low-grade shield generator, the Claw is primarily a support fighter. The EMP damage it deals is temporarily crippling to poorly-shielded targets, but it's incapable of dealing much permanent damage on its own.",,,,
drone_borer,SHIP,"Slow and not very sturdy, this combat-modified mining drone is nonetheless capable of keeping hostiles off its mothership for a time. Fielded in numbers, it can even present a credible threat to smaller combat ships.",,,,
drone_terminator,SHIP,"A point-defense drone built around the dreaded Terminator Core target analyzer, which finds transient weak points on missiles and fighters with unerring precision. Rumors about the core's AI intermittently exceeding the generally-allowed delta level during complex combat situations remain unproven.",,,,
doom,SHIP,"Designed when phase technology was generally unknown and phase detectors were not a standard of every sensor package, this cruiser has lost the advantage of surprise - but retains a dangerous and flexible weapons loadout. 

Certain unnerving psychological phenomena have been reported by sensitive crew members after enduring many rapid phase-shifts in combat conditions. Domain Navy reports on the subject were never declassified and are thought to have been lost since the Collapse.",,,,
shade,SHIP,"The smallest phase ship operated in the Sector, the Shade-class is often used as a scout for larger fleets. In battle, it is valued by fleet admirals for its ability to disable enemy ships with its EMP emitter.",,,,
afflictor,SHIP,A dangerous and swift phase frigate with a weapons loadout that is powerful enough to bring down much heavier ships. The Afflictor possesses a device which exploits a unique modification of its integrated phase coil array to project a field of anomalously amplified entropy. This effects a devastating increase in destructive instability in delicate or finely tuned systems when the targeted vessel experiences chaotic high-energy events ie. combat damage. Everything that can possibly go wrong does.,,,,
harbinger,SHIP,"A deadly phase destroyer feared and scorned by those crews who have suffered the misfortune of facing it in battle. The Harbinger possesses a device which allows it to briefly disable enemy ships, creating openings that it - or its allies - can exploit.

""The Tri-Tachyon Corporation denies allegations of ongoing involvement in phasing experiments, much less the - and I quote - 'clandestine development and operation of phase warships' which would of course be in direct violation of the Treaty of Thule. It is Company policy to pursue full persecution of individuals, mercantile bodies, spiritual clades, and any registered polities committing gross and flagrant defamation to the full extent of local jurisdictional power as per the Sector Commercial Accords of Cycle 32 AC. Our legal team will be in touch.""",,,,
gremlin,SHIP,"This ancient phase prototype rig was never intended for mass production, yet someone managed to extract its reverse-engineered blueprints from the firmware of a nanoforge. The resulting skeleton of hull is given standard armour cladding, the merest nod of a life-support module, and as many missiles as can be crammed into the remaining voids.

The Gremlin, as it became known, is hated by its crew who suffer not only the dubious honour of a close-in strike role but also the disturbing wash of the prototype phase coil. Substance abuse is ubiquitous. An awful little ship.",,,,
bastillon,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.
  
The Bastillon was a hopeful project of Mbaye-Gogol to up-size its popular ""Defender""-class specialized point-defense war drone. It is bigger, tougher, more heavily armed - and rather more lucrative per-unit to the MGA bottom-line.",,,,
berserker,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Berserker is a considerably up-sized, up-armed, and up-armoured cousin of the Warden-class for use against heavier opposition. As an automated drone the Berserker's combat algorithms make little consideration for its own survival, instead pursuing and attacking its target relentlessly until either it or the target is destroyed.",,,,
defender,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Defender was one of the most commonly seen war drones used by the Domain as it was deployed to harden frontier convoys and vulnerable outposts in a point defense role.",,,,
sentry,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Sentry war drone is packed with missiles and provided cheap, automated fire support to thinly-stretched frontier patrols.",,,,
warden,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Warden was feared and hated by pirates on the frontier of the Domain for the relatively heavy firepower it would unleash upon unshielded craft. Often denigrated in Luddic propaganda as a ""murdering machine"" for the merciless aggression it displayed when activated.",,,,
picket,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Numerous vulnerabilities leave the Picket-class drone easy to underestimate, but woe to the captain who commits this error. If the Picket is allowed to follow its programming to close aggressively with its target, it will unleash shockingly dense volume of light-caliber fire to rip apart unarmored hulls.",,,,
rampart,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Little more than an artillery platform with engines, the Rampart was attached to drone units to provide the heavy firepower necessary to meet cruiser and capital class hulls in the line of combat or to crack armoured orbital fortresses. In either role, heavy losses were anticipated, so the Rampart was designed with highly modular components which allowed badly damaged hulls to be rapidly cannibalized to repair lightly damaged hulls up to combat capacity without the need for shipyard facilities.",,,,
guardian,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Nothing like this, however, could possibly have been deployed by the Domain drone armadas.

There are elements of standard droneships within the hull structure, but they are covered by malevolently angled glacises and illogical tangles of conduit. Surely this monstrous vessel is the product of some deranged Domain naval architect, or a production chip corrupted by exposure to kilolights of faulty drive field?",,,,
ziggurat,SHIP,"A plaque on the bridge declares this ship class to be the result of ""Project Ziggurat"". It appears to be built on technology created in a Tri-Tachyon prototype lab unknown to the Persean Sector at-large. In addition to advanced conventional loadout, there are certain one-off components of exotic manufacture - it is possible to reverse-engineer undamaged examples and produce replacements, but the underlying operating principles do not resemble any known Domain technology and thus remain a mystery.

The Ziggurat-class ship once had a human crew; or, at least, was intended to be crewed by humans. No sign of them remains as physical evidence or in databanks. Even the cleanest Hegemony warship will have some initials and a rude word or two about the CO scratched behind a maintenance hatch. Here, nothing.",Unidentified Vessel,Target profile resembles a phase-enabled hull on a theoretically impossible scale; likely highly unstable.

Selling AI cores on the open market is prohibited by most factions. However, higher-up faction representatives are often willing to exchange AI cores for large sums of cash when communicated with directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

The alpha-level AI core is the physical soul of a fearsome alien intelligence. An alpha can create art which perfectly simulates human pathos, plausibly debate any philosophical position, and form what appear to be deep and meaningful bonds with human beings. Alphas have been known to perform elaborate 'jokes' built over years which can only be appreciated due to the intention that a particular human subject become cognitive of the whole at a specific time and context.

Although the locus of vast material and intellectual investment, alphas terrified Domain strategic planners. Like all AI, each alpha was watched, controlled, and ruthlessly eliminated at the first sign of disloyalty. The Hegemony carries on these policies with even greater fervor.",,,,
beta_core,RESOURCE,"A beta-level AI core is capable of ably supporting most human endeavors, matching not-quite-human performance with its prodigious computational ability. Assigning a beta to aid human overseers in administering a colony-wide industry brings significant benefits.

A beta-level AI core can easily pass for human, given anonymized communications protocols, and will readily and ably lie if deception is required to perform a given task. The beta employs cognitive modelling of human actors to anticipate reactions and emotional responses, though it is difficult to describe exactly what, if anything, the beta feels. Records on the subject are patchy and contradictory; a popular theory is that a beta will model a new personality for each human it comes into contact with.",,,,
gamma_core,RESOURCE,"A gamma-level AI core is capable of supporting most human endeavors, making up for a lack of creativity and problem-solving ability with prodigous computational prowess.

Selling AI cores on the open market is prohibited by most factions. However, higher-up faction representatives are often willing to exchange AI cores for large sums of cash when communicated with directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

A rare and valuable independent AI core, the gamma-level is the lowest tier core considered to be truly intelligent under Domain-era AI protocols.

Or so they claim. The Luddic Path necessarily finds itself at odds with nearly all other factions in the Sector.",,,,
pirates,FACTION,"Not technically a unified faction but more a loose category of bandits, brigands, deserters, looters, soldiers of fortune, mercenaries, and free captains that share a common belligerence with the established powers of the Sector. Many pirates are runaways from the mainstream Sector society - usually oppressed by the status quo, stowaways from core worlds. Most pirate captains would hardly call themselves such, rather seeing themselves as challengers to the inept rule of the Hegemony or the League, seeking vengeance for the wrongs caused by such a misled society and taking what they can take through their cleverness and audacity. These captains can be characterized by their insatiable thirst for freedom and glory. Naturally, they give little thought to those that carry an official identification beacon, reserving their magnanimity for their fellow-travelers - other pirates.",,,,
sindrian_diktat,FACTION,"The Sindrian Diktat is a polity founded in a relatively recent Hegemony military intervention in the Askonia system led by Admiral Philip Andrada, formerly of the Hegemony Navy. Andrada's Hegemony psych profile describes him as ""intelligent, charismatic, yet prone to narcissistic excess"". In his words, the Diktat was ""formed in the crucible of the Askonia Crisis and with it a new people: a race of humans with emboldened spirit and clarity of purpose; stronger, possessing the will and determination to overcome the divisions and petty parliamentary politics that bred only chaos when tested by the collapse of the Gate System."" Considered by the Sector at large to be a military dictatorship.",,,,
asharu_platform,CUSTOM,"An abandoned orbital staging area for the Asharu terraforming project. Castoff bulk-carrier segments welded between a honeycomb of emptied fuel tanks once formed concourses teeming with engineers and colonists. The hangars stand empty but for a few slumped, stripped hulks. Passive energy collectors and tertiary life-support modules keep the station functioning and in orbit, barely. No one would expect to find anything of value here.",,,,
pirate_base_generic,CUSTOM,"A pirate base where ""adventurers"", freebooters, mercenaries and other such scum and villainy gather. Usually a small outpost hiding in the dark places between the spheres of major factions' interest.

planet_barad_a,CUSTOM,"The thick, icy crust of this world is fed by cryovolcanoes that dot the surface. These frozen wastes are scored by mass-driver gantries from a time when the volatile elements of this world were extracted on a massive scale to feed terraforming efforts elsewhere in-system. Some of the old equipment has been appropriated by scattered bands of independent miners who scratch out a meagre living between the glaciers of ammonia-ice.",,,,
pirate_base_barad,CUSTOM,"Originally built by Eridani-Utopia to coordinate volatiles extraction for massive terraforming projects, the station has been taken over by adventurers, freebooters, mercenaries seeking to avoid the watchful eye and heavy hand of the Hegemony.

Independent miners who work the moons of Barad gather here to sell their hauls, trade tall tales, and otherwise unwind.",,,,
station_achaman_enterprise,CUSTOM,"The value of Achaman Station is as a relatively safe port of call for the various inhabitants of Guayota's Disk to interact with traders from the Sector at-large, who otherwise rarely risk the pirates and difficult navigation of the Disk. The Tri-Tachyon Corporation, as 'caretaker' of the station, is well-situated to exploit its value handily - and do. It is often said that everything is for sale at Achaman Station.",,,,

hegemony,FACTION,"The Hegemony is a martial successor state to the Domain formed by a lost legion trapped in a backwater system by the collapse of the Domain gate network. Built upon a creative interpretation of protocols which indefinitely extends Domain-style martial law, the founders of the Hegemony believed that the overriding cause of restoring the Domain and therefore stability, peace, and prosperity to the Sector and indeed the entire galaxy must come before certain niceties of human rights. The survival of humanity is at stake and it is only the discipline of the Hegemony military that protects worlds where some semblance of the normalcy of human civilization can be nurtured. Anything that threatens the Great Cause must be neutralized; if a few activists must be discouraged for the greater good, so be it.

Civilian hierarchies exist to govern the planets and stations under Hegemony rule but are entirely subordinate to the military. The specifics of civilian organization varies between worlds, as was Domain policy. When in doubt, the Hegemony applies a modified Domain-era colonial charter to dictate political organization. This standard-charter civilian hierarchy is generally elected, however as per martial law valid candidates must be approved by the local military authority. Exceptional times require exceptional measures, yet still the Hegemony fosters the flickering flame of galactic democracy under the same principles that founded the Domain.
 ",,,,
tritachyon,FACTION,"The most powerful megacorporation in the Sector after the fall of the Domain gate system, Tri-Tachyon specialized in cutting-edge AI development (including several notable cases of violating the Domain ban on autonomous alpha+ level AI) and exotic high-power devices (starship engines and warp drives, power generators, energy converters, forcefields). Since the Collapse, Tri-Tachyon has vastly diversified its operations and insinuated itself throughout the Sector. Even hostile factions, paranoid of hardwired backdoors, find themselves forced to employ standard Tri-Tachyon devices, beginning with the ubiquitous Tri-Tachyon PDA.

From a certain perspective, the Tri-Tachyon corporate charters peculiar algorithmic self-modifying features might be considered to be an abstract form of AI which makes use of human corporate officers as integral components, though this is a philosophical argument which was never satisfactorily resolved in a way that led to any additional convictions of violating the Domains AI ban.",,,,
persean,FACTION,"An alliance formed to counter Hegemony domination of the Sector. Members of the League dont necessarily agree on all issues, domestic or otherwise, and may even come into armed conflict with one another. But the League is united when it comes to the Hegemony who they consider to be illegitimately enforcing martial law in the name of the Domain, a dead political entity. The League, by its laws, unites against other external threats such as particularly meddlesome megacorporations, warlords, and the Luddic Path. 

The Persean League is not intrinsically egalitarian or for individual freedom as-such  the purpose of the League is freedom of the constituent polities with any matters of internal politics of those polities to be left to their own devices. While the Domain might have intervened against the domestic policies of the worlds it ruled, the League specifically forbids such intervention.",,,,
independent,FACTION,"Not a unified faction as such, the Independents are a loose category of polities and free agents unified more by a lack of association with a major faction than any shared qualities. Independent worlds and the spacers who call them home often share reputation data, trade generously among themselves, and will readily cooperate to perform short-term security and military actions to better protect what freedom they have maintained by working together. Equally likely, trust can break down, and Independents will suspiciously deny each other favors, compete viciously, and turn a blind eye to the misfortune of neighbours.",,,,
planet_chicomoztoc,CUSTOM,"One of the first planets targeted for colonization in the Sector, Chicomoztoc was selected to become a center of industry, host to a nexus of huge nanoforges. Only a marginal terraforming candidate upon discovery, rapid early industry and later war has left the atmosphere choked with complex sulphur compounds, organics refining by-products, and a concerning but manageable dusting of actinides.",,"The enormous population of Chicomoztoc lives in underground arcologies ruled in turn by powerful demagogues - promising reform and jobs for the masses of unemployed - or members of the numerous competing technocrat/criminal patronage networks serving their home hive-coalition or, as often, whoever has bought them off.

planet_eventide,CUSTOM,"Eventide is a nearly tidally-locked world that was found to otherwise be an ideal candidate for terraforming. Just one day passes on Eventide per year, or near enough, leading to extreme winter-night and summer-day with mild twilight periods between. Judicious employment of stellar mirrors and shades allows ideal conditions to prevail in large pockets of carefully maintained territory where the majority of the population is settled in leased urban cantons surrounded by vast aristocratic estate-plantations.",,"Leading families of Eventide sponsor the solar mirrors and shades which maintain islands of habilitability. The disgraced and poor, meanwhile, live in the twilight peripheries where the harsh climactic shifts of the slow summer-day/winter-night seasonal cycle must be endured in full force.

After the Second AI War the entire Yma binary system was declared a demilitarized zone.

hyperspace_wavefront,TERRAIN,TODO,,,,
kite,SHIP,"A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This compact space/aircraft is streamlined for efficient atmospheric flight and boasts a grid of cleverly distributed short-burst maneuvering thrusters coordinated by a delta-level AI subsystem to ensure smooth landings (a point driven home by Fabrique marketing by way of amusing ad-holos featuring a well-dressed couple and an overfull wine glass). The Kite has powerful engines for a civilian ship of its size, though zero-G maneuverability leaves something to be desired when the special subsystem is not engaged.

In the dangerous cycles post-Collapse, the Kite has been outfitted with a defense turret in place of the executive-class viewing dome and the two auxiliary jet-pods are replaced with missile systems (which do not need to draw on the limited powerplant). It won't stand up in a fair fight, but the Kite can be given unexpectedly sharp teeth and use its speed to escape from raiders. Luddic Path radicals have even been known to use modified Kite to deliver strike weapons against helpless freighters, followed by engaging the maneuvering subsystem to make a swift exit to avoid the wrath of their victim's escort.",F,,,
gryphon,SHIP,"The Gryphon is a dedicated missile cruiser designed to provide a highly mobile platform for heavy fire support. It is not a front-line cruiser, and so operates best when provided with escorts.

Among the so-called ""Cruiser School"" wave of ships designed by Altair Exotech, the Gryphon was a key component of the power-projection strategy that came into vogue shortly before the collapse of the Gate system. The Gryphon was meant to allow a task force commander to rapidly concentrate bursts of specialized heavy firepower, forming a devastating hammer to the anvil of assault-class cruisers and destroyers. So reads the Domain-era tactical manual, anyway.

Of particular interest is the Gryphon's hull-integrated missile nanoforge: this fixed architecture nanoforge system allows extremely rapid conversion of densely packed, pre-formulated feedstock into a narrow range of munitions in the midst of battle. This allows the Gryphon to effectively convert concentrated mass into desired armaments, allowing for mid-battle replenishment of missile stocks. The flux output of this process is, of course, tremendous so it is not advisable for captains who are relying on their shields to block enemy fire to engage the integrated missile nanoforge system.",,,,
hammer,WEAPON,"This dumb-fire rocket was ubiquitous in the Sector pre-Collapse due to civilian applications discovered by asteroid miners.

squall,WEAPON,"Medium-range anti-shield missiles intended to be used in the opening round of a combat encounter to disable the shields of an unwary opponent, opening up an opportunity for high-damage anti-armour projectiles to be deployed in the immediate aftermath of the Squall salvo.

Interchangeable missile pods were designed to allow for ease of rapid reloading of the impressive 20-shot Squall salvo, but the high mass of the pods and finicky mechanicals of the missile autoloaders make the process unwieldy and the timing falls somewhat below the original Domain Armada specifications. Nonetheless, the Squall is a terrifying weapon system when deployed against shield-reliant combatants as it forces a captain with insufficient point defense system to deactivate their shields or submit to high shield flux which may lead to overload. ",,,,
locust,WEAPON,"A large, short range guided missile system designed to launch large numbers of projectiles to overwhelm and cripple enemy fighter squadrons in a single salvo. The Locust can be used against larger targets, but will have little relative effect unless shields and armour are already breached.

The Locust launches bursts of twenty small missiles per salvo. Robust, low-power individual tracking systems are coordinated by a distributed swarm intelligence system to enable excellent tracking of targets, while chemical microthrusters provide maneuverability for a short time. Tried and true targeting algorithms based on the old standby Swarmer missile systems allow Locusts to miss only rarely. The Locust has rightly earned a place in the nightmares of fighter pilots.",,,,

starliner,SHIP,"A passenger liner from a more civilized age, the Mbaye-Gogol 440 ""Starliner"" was built to travel between the systems of the Domain in speed and comfort. The Starliner features private first-class cabins, two classes of food service, a zero-G theatre, and even a small landing/launch bay for exclusive use by executive-class passengers. (Being a civilian ship there are, of course, no facilities for fighter repair and rearmament).

The Starliner is equipped with a forward shield to ensure passenger safety and protect the hull from routine abrasion. Refitted for the current realities of the Sector, this ship class is routinely equipped with all-band anti-missile flare launchers as well as a number of gun turrets; this serves not only to evoke a sense of adventure, but discourage casual piracy while justifying a ""munitions surcharge"" on each ticket sale.",,,,
nebula,SHIP,"The voluminous but ungainly hull of the Mbaye-Gogol 430 ""Nebula"" does little to enhance the romance of interstellar travel but it does ensure a respectable passenger and cargo capacity for a ship of its class. Indeed, the Nebula has slowly come to dominate mid-tier passenger service since the muted reception of its first line of production.

The Nebula is equipped with a forward-facing shield to enhance the safety of passengers and extend the hull plating's maintenance schedule. And the Sector being what it is, several ballistic turrets and anti-missile all-band flare launchers have been mounted at fortuitous locations to assure paying passengers that their well-being is a top priority of the operator.",,,,
mudskipper,SHIP,"Most commonly used as interplanetary ferry, the Mudskipper is indeed interstellar-capable. The ship has no built-in shield generator so must rely on its durable - for a civilian craft - armour to protect passengers and cargo. There is little hope for the Mudskipper in combat, but it is generally equipped with a rear-facing turret to foil attacks by the ever-popular Salamander missile.

The MGA-220 was first produced as the ""Pegasus""-class but was soon anointed with the altogether more humble name ""Mudskipper"". This tough little ship has been a mainstay in backwater civilian transport for centuries, and although not pretty, the rugged construction simplifies maintenance and generous bay doors allow for great versatility. To this point, the Mudskipper's image in the public mind was cemented by a somewhat unlikely holovid sequence featuring a Mudskipper transporting a herd of bovids to a picturesque arid-terraform.",,,,
scarab,SHIP,"The Scarab is a rare, experimental hull developed by the Tri-Tachyon corporation. Only a limited run of prototypes has been produced.

Gross causality violating technology was banned by the Domain, and this ban is now upheld by Hegemony doctrine - with Luddic support. Nonetheless, it is the handful of fringe-examples of this technology which form the foundation for interstellar human civilization from the old Gate system (depending on one's theory of its operation) to common FTL hyperspace travel and communication. Tri-Tachyon has always pushed the bleeding edge of these technologies - and of the law - by spearheading development of phase technology. The Scarab's uniquely hull-integrated prototype ""Temporal Shell"" system is no exception. 

So it is not so much that the Scarab manipulates time as it avoids the normal rate of consequence of the local frame of reference. The effect, as upsetting to Luddic theologians as it is to laymen, is to seemingly slow time for the outside world. Of course one must avoid stating it thus in earshot of the applied temporal physicists who deal in such miracles to avoid a tedious correction of terminology. ",,,,
centurion,SHIP,"A solid heavy combat frigate, the Centurion can be counted upon to fill and hold gaps in the line of battle, as per the Domain-era doctrine practiced by the successor-state of the XIV Battlegroup.

The Centurion is valued for its versatility due to an abundance of hybrid weapon slots and an integrated Damper Field that allows it to shrug off the fearsome firepower it is sure to face in combat.",,,,
wayfarer,SHIP,"With respectable armour and armament for a heavy frigate, the Wayfarer does not cut close the ruthless economy that would suit it for bulk trade on the dedicated lanes where safety is guaranteed by civilized locale (or, at least, an armed escort). No, the Wayfarer is a starship for the lonely runs on the frontier, between worlds where the tough law of necessity reigns, where brigands roam, and the crossed arcs of one's own gun turrets are the best comfort to be found in the cold reach of space. ",,,,
ionpulser,WEAPON,"Built for improved firepower, this enhanced version of the Ion Cannon delivers an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) which can quickly disable enemy systems and engines, dealing heavy damage and arcing to modules near the points of impact.

The Ion Pulser's nonstandard gain medium projects highly-ionized baryonic matter in a coherent bolt via one of three rotating linear accelerator apparati. When the ion bolt impacts the target it creates a localized magnetic field which plays havoc with all manner of electronics, including sensors, fuel igniters, targeting modules, computers, etc. The weapon also fuses certain circuits, and can mildly strain shield generators, thus it does negligible amount of permanent damage. Rarely the only weapon type fitted on ships.",,,,
ionbeam,WEAPON,"A long-range support weapon, the Ion Beam is able to fire more and more disruptive EMP arcs through shields as the target's hard flux levels go up - at a hefty flux cost for the firing ship.

After delivery of the Ion Pulser to the Chernabog Proving Grounds, firing tests and tactical simulations concluded that the weapon system was unsuitable for the role described in the original bid won by Bhilai Exospace. A heavy penalty was deducted from the delivery fee and engineers sent back to produce a charged energy weapon with sufficient range to be mounted on combat platforms expected to be placed behind rather than on the front line of combat. Six months later, they delivered the Ion Beam.

The long range Ion Beam employs a cutting-edge gain pattern best understood as a form of diffracted geometry projected into normal space. Difficult to manufacture, this unique construction nonetheless enables long-range projection of highly-ionized baryonic matter in a coherent beam known to play havoc with all manner of electronics, including sensors, fuel igniters, targeting modules, computers, etc., though it does negligible permanent damage. Operated against a high-flux target, the Ion Beam may occasionally build up a charge that will arc past energy shields entirely as the buildup of charged particles interferes with the shield diffusion cycle.",,,,
mora,SHIP,"This class of carrier was commissioned during the same period of carrier-centric Domain naval doctrine as the ubiquitous Talon fighter. Armoured to withstand the fury of battle alongside the Onslaught, the Mora was nonetheless decommissioned en masse as doctrine shifted to favour heavier guns and capital ships flanked by line-cruisers. 

Demilitarized hulls were sold and converted into mobile industrial platforms for use on the frontiers of the Domain. The rugged and eminently adaptable Mora was a common sight in long-range surveying, mining, construction, drone handling, and use as mobile drydocks. Some hulls were even half-buried on alien worlds and used as armoured power-stations and workshops to form the core of new settlements.

After the Collapse, Mora hulls were re-militarized almost suspiciously rapidly by factions that did not possess dedicated fleet carriers. Today they are an anvil upon which many an unwary Pirate warlord is broken.",,,,

legion,SHIP,"Classified as a battlecarrier, the Legion mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons, hangar-space, and command-control sufficient to field four fighter wings.

After the legendary success of the Onslaught design it became clear that rebellious systems without ultra-heavy industry were able to develop carrier-based strike-craft capable of countering the 'Old Man' of the Armada. Alongside new weapons - nimble anti-fighter missiles and rapid-tracking point defense cannon - the Strategic Council decided to deploy a carrier worthy of service alongside the Onslaught. Thus the Legion was designed to provide a platform for interceptors and strike-craft while standing on the line of battle. 

Proponents of the 'Cruiser School' criticized the Legion for insufficient specialization, maintaining that similar fighter volume can be fielded at less cost and greater flexibility if combat roles are separated into distinct ship hulls.

planet_ancyra,CUSTOM,"A dry and old world with a sluggish magnetic field partially stripped of volatiles by solar wind.

station_derinkuyu,CUSTOM,Derinkuyu Station was built post-collapse on the superstructure of maintenance gantries intended for Atlas-class freighters. These were welded together and boosted out of Ancyra's gravity well then stabilized in Galatian asteroid belt to serve as a base for mining operations.

cobra,SHIP,"The Cobra design was initiated not long before the Collapse, born of a speculative project to mount a reaper torpedo launcher on a fighter chassis.  

The design requirements spun out out control almost immediately, and schedule overruns should have seen the Cobra project killed in its first cycle. But the eccentric owner - who had made his fortune in frontier prospecting and salvage - poured his fortune into the design and allegedly secured short-term loans from certain criminal elements to see prototype development through. The Domain Naval Procurement Board rejected the proposal outright and it's been suggested that this was due to an unstated policy of ""discouraging"" anti-capital torpedo bombers.

The development lead was found dead in extraordinary unpleasant circumstances; investigators ruled it a suicide. Meanwhile, much to the chagrin of legitimate lenders, the Cobra's schematics and prototype LPCs apparently disappeared into thin air.",,,,
perdition,SHIP,"The combat-modified Perdition torpedo bomber is an attempt by Luddic militants of both Pather and more moderate sects to address a chronic lack of access to heavy ordnance, particularly during the early days of the Collapse. A common civilian survey/delivery Cranefly-class utility shuttle serves as the base chassis. Originally designed to carry a small cargo package or a few suited-up spacers, the Perdition is welded into an ungainly shell of makeshift armour and the hold doors removed to mount a single Hammer torpedo keyed to the old cargo latch system.

Great faith is required to pilot this haphazard vehicle into battle because its survivability stats should dissuade any rational crew.",,,,

phantom,SHIP,"An advanced troop transport employing phase stealth technology, this design was put to effective use by Tri-Tachyon black ops during the Second AI War. The Phantom should avoid ship-to-ship combat as integrated armor and weaponry are only rated effective versus light ground targets.

""The system patrols should have seen the Tachies coming, but didn't. ADA was tracking the bogey right up until it disappeared off the scope, leaving the ground guns spinning in circles trying to reacquire a target.

revenant,SHIP,"A stealth freighter which audaciously employs phase technology to support covert fleet operations, the Revenant is not cheap or efficient. Raised up from a dusty set of databanks hidden in an unnamed rock orbiting a nondescript star for a hundred cycles after the First AI War, the Revenant schematics provided an immense boon to the logistics of Tri-Tachyon raiders during the Second AI War.

Hegemony lawyers considered declaring the design illegal, but evidence of alpha-level AI influence was deemed insufficient. The lead prosecutor insisted so strongly that this was itself evidence of the work of an alpha that the High Hegemon found it politic to recuse them from the proceedings.",,,,
champion,SHIP,"The Champion-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring a range of powerful energy weapons; the crowning element is a heavy energy turret mounting, rare among midline ships. This offensive array is backed by a robust energy grid capable of supercharging the energy weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. A heavy missile hardpoint complements the loadout by enabling the Champion to unleash a crippling strike without taxing flux levels. The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.

A relatively recent design, the Champion is a product of the historically recent ""Cruiser School"" naval revolution that never saw active service in the pre-collapse Domain Armada. Although prototypes were constructed and forge-ready specifications distributed to several battlegroups, the Champion was never cleared for active deployment due to an ongoing lawsuit between Altair Exotech and Orion Shipyards. Each megacorp accused the other of industrial espionage and innappropriately influencing the Armada officers overseeing the procurement process. The truth was more complex, inflaming longstanding rivalries in the officer corps as the investigatory committee called witness after witness. The Collapse prevented any sort of conclusive ruling from reaching the Persean Sector however, and now the entire matter is considered irrelevant. With the discovery of Champion plans on a Domain armaments courier, the warship was quickly put into service by the fleet of the Persean League, among others.",,,,
fury,SHIP,"A fast-attack high-tech light cruiser, the Fury is designed to choose when and where it strikes to inflict maximum effect upon the enemy. The specialized inbuilt plasma 'microburn' system allows the Fury to make small dashes at high speed to catch unwary opponents off-guard.

The Fury-class is the Shrike-classes big sibling, a product of the same design team asked to fulfill slightly updated requirements, including resolution of the longstanding hull corrosion issue without, it was hoped, introducing any new problems. This was largely successful (once the chaos of several indignant resignations was sorted out).

Dismissed by heavy-armor-ballistic-firepower traditionalists as 'just another small-bore glass cannon', the Fury has nonetheless proven quite dangerous in the hands of quick-thinking fleet commanders.",,,,
vanguard,SHIP,"An ancient and tough heavy frigate featuring robust construction, a combat burn drive, and no modern shields. Instead, the Vanguard is equipped with an integrated Damper Field of archaic design but tuned to modern standards. This allows the Vanguard to allocate 100% of flux buildup to weapon systems, leaving defense to its heavy armor enhanced by the obscure physics of resonant field-dampening.

This design is old enough to be contemporary with early models of the Onslaught battleship, though unlike that illustrious pillar of the Domain Navy the Vanguard was retired from service long before the collapse of the Gate network. In the post-Collapse chaos it was a chance discovery by an enterprising arms dealer that saw relatively complete schematics of the Vanguard-class heavy frigate lifted from an overlooked museum exhibit. The atavistic and aggressive design opens an unexpected niche for the Vanguard in modern fleets - with the added advantage that all essential components have been declassified for ages, and are of simple make; even repair of catastrophic damage is relatively straightforward.",,,,
manticore,SHIP,"The Manticore is loved by frontier officers for its ability to rapidly bring firepower to bear in small engagements and loathed by Domain strategic planners for interfering with the orderly schema of official fleet doctrine. The Manticore's oversized primary weapon mount and built-in rangefinder are a gunner's dream but allow this destroyer to easily overextend itself in battle. That, operators argue, is what the canister flak system is for - and stripping the paint off your allied ships, as the old joke goes. 

A healthy respect for intimidating firepower in a small package see this design continue in the service of fleets of the Persean Sector. When the opportunity presents itself, pirates are particularly keen to recover a Manticore hull and apply blood-red livery to their overgunned prize.",,,,
eradicator,SHIP,"A resilient design often overlooked by history, the Eradicator-class fast cruiser features powerful dual engine nacelles that allow it to deliver uncompromising firepower and a powerful missile barrage to the weakest point of the enemy battleline - or come to the rescue of valuable assets that have found themselves tactically exposed.

Back in the long cycles of the Domain, a chance accident during a fleet demonstration set one of an Eradicator's engine nacelles into shutdown and the other into overdrive, putting the ship into a terrible spin only stopped by a heroic effort from the engineering crew. Worse than the injuries and casualties suffered was the ship class becoming the laughingstock of a significant portion of the Domain hypermedia sphere. To save face the admiralty quietly assigned all of the Eradicators to frontier duty, far from the fickle attentions of the core sector budget committees. It would take a generation and several difficult fringe rebellion mop-up operations before a new fast-cruiser class model was requested by the Domain Navy to replace the Eradicator's role in front-line battlefleets.",,,,
